# Ethical Considerations in Web Scraping

## Purpose of Data Collection

The primary purpose of our project, FundMonitor, is to collect data on the performance of social causes in terms of funds raised, geographical trends, and the pace of fundraising. By gathering this data, we aim to identify patterns and trends that can inform nonprofits, donors, and social researchers. The insights gained will help optimize fundraising strategies and provide a better understanding of which causes are receiving the most public attention and support.

## Why Are We Collecting This Data?

This data is being collected strictly for **educational and research purposes**. The goal is to enhance the understanding of fundraising trends and provide actionable insights that can help organizations, philanthropists, and other stakeholders focus their efforts on the most impactful causes. We are not using the data for commercial purposes or for profit-driven activities. Our analysis is aimed at helping the social impact sector make informed decisions that benefit the public good.

## Collection Practices

We follow ethical web scraping practices to ensure that our activities do not cause any harm or disruption to the website we collect data from:

- **One-Time Scraping**: Our program is designed to scrape data only once per execution, ensuring that it does not extract data at frequent or short intervals. This minimizes the potential load on the website’s infrastructure.
- **Frequency and Intensity**: We limit the frequency of scraping requests to prevent any impact on the performance or availability of the websites we target. Our scraping is conducted in a way that avoids placing a significant load on the website’s infrastructure.
- **Respect for Restrictions**: We do not bypass password protection, paywalls, or other restricted areas of the website. Our scraping is limited to publicly accessible pages only.
- **Compliance with Terms of Service**: Section 4.24(f) of the Chuffed.org terms of service prohibits activities that impose an "unreasonably large load" on their infrastructure. We take this seriously and ensure that our scraping activities are light and do not overburden the website.

## Data Handling and Privacy

We handle all collected data with the highest regard for privacy and security:

- **No Collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or sensitive data. The data collected is focused entirely on fundraising statistics, such as the total amounts raised and the geographical locations of campaigns.
- **Secure Data Storage**: All data collected will be securely stored and handled. We ensure that sensitive files are excluded from public repositories by using `.gitignore`, preventing any unintended exposure.
- **Anonymization**: If any of the collected data is used for public display or distribution, it will be anonymized to protect the privacy of individuals or organizations.

## Data Usage

The data collected from this project will be used strictly for **educational and research purposes**. We ensure that:

- The data will not be used for commercial gain, sold, or redistributed in ways that could violate the privacy or intellectual property rights of the original sources.
- Any published findings or shared insights derived from this data will be used to further the understanding of fundraising trends and help organizations optimize their social impact.

## Conclusion

We recognize that responsible data collection is key to maintaining ethical standards in web scraping. By adhering to the following principles:
  
- Limiting our requests to reduce the load on the website's infrastructure
- Scraping only once, ensuring minimal impact on the website's resources
- Avoiding any collection of sensitive or personal information
- Ensuring secure and ethical handling of the data

FundMonitor aims to provide valuable insights while ensuring that the rights and resources of the websites and individuals we interact with are respected. By following these practices, we maintain the integrity of the data collection process and contribute positively to the social good.
